# 457 Game Project

For my project I will be making a simple quiz show game using TCP sockets and python. Hoping to be able to add plenty of features and learn about networks.

**How to play:**
1. **Start the server:** Run the `game-server.py` script with `python3 game-server.py <IP address> <Port Number> <Number of Players>`
2. **Connect clients:** Run the `game-client.py` script with `python3 game-server.py <IP address> <Port Number>`
3. **Enter Player/Client Names:** Once the specified `<Number of Players>` have connected to the server, each client will be prompted to enter thier name, simply enter a name and press return.
4. **More to come** 

**Technologies used:**
* Python
* Sockets
