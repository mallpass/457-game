# 457 Game Project

For my project I will be making a simple quiz show game using TCP sockets and python. Hoping to be able to add plenty of features and learn about networks.

**How to play:**
1. **Start the server:** Run the `server.py` script.
2. **Connect clients:** Run the `client.py` script on two different machines or terminals.
3. **More to come**

**Technologies used:**
* Python
* Sockets
